// Repetition with Loops
// Doing things over and over

// Loop is the simplest way to repeat an action in Rust. It runs the code inside the loop block until you explicitly tell it to stop.
// 1- loop
// 2- while
// 3- for

// 1- loop
// The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.


fn main() {
    // Loop keyword
    loop {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}
